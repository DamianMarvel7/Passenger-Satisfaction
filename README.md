# Passenger-Satisfaction

This project aims to predict passenger satisfaction based on an airline passenger satisfaction survey dataset. The dataset contains various features such as gender, customer type, age, type of travel, class, flight distance, and satisfaction ratings for different services provided during the flight.

The main objectives of this project are as follows:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct an in-depth analysis of the dataset to gain insights into the distributions, relationships, and patterns of the variables. Visualizations and statistical summaries will be used to understand the data better.
- Feature Engineering: Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Feature engineering techniques may be applied to extract relevant information from the existing features or create new features that could potentially improve the predictive performance.
- Correlation Analysis: Identify the features that are highly correlated with passenger satisfaction. This analysis will help understand which factors significantly influence passenger satisfaction and aid in feature selection for the machine learning model.
- Machine Learning Model Development: Build a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to accurately predict passenger satisfaction. Various models such as logistic regression, random forest, or gradient boosting will be explored. The dataset will be divided into training and testing sets for model training, evaluation, and validation.
- Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy. Cross-validation techniques may be employed to obtain robust performance estimates.
- Model Deployment: Once a satisfactory model is developed, it can be deployed as a service or integrated into an application for real-time prediction of passenger satisfaction. The model's deployment use Gradio.
